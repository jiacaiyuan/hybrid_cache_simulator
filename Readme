//Project:  hybrid cache simulator
//***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****
Description:
	The project is the simulator of Cache which can be configed flexible
	The driven of the Hybrid Cache Simulator is the Trace that generated from Modified Gem5&NVMain simulator
	Other Traces if meets the format of the simulator is fine
	Also you can config your own trace format by yourself
	The Trace Format as Follows:
		Memory:
			addr lenth data0 data1......datai....data(lenth-1)
			Note: (lenth<= CacheLine setting)
		CMD:
			cycle opreation(R/W) addr lenth data0 data......datai...data(lenth-1) owner
			Note: (lenth<= CMD_WIDTH setting)
	The Stats of the Simulator also can be added flexible by yourself
	Note: 	the name of Hybrid is that it can be used in the PCM/DRAM hybrid Memory system,
			and it can also be used in the normal memory system well.


Directory:
	bin: the compiled executable file
	demo: the demo that the initial trace and the command&memory trace
	obj: the compiled and linked file
	src: the source code of cache simulator system
		cache: the base functions of CacheBlock
		cmd: the process of command trace
		include: the data struct and system config
		mem: the process of memory trace
		policy:
			consistency: the cache consistency control
			replace: the cache replace policy control
		stats:
			the statistics of the cache system
	utils: the script of process the initial trace 

Usage:
	make base : compile the base functions of Hybrid Cache Simulator
	make LRU : compile the policy of cache lru replace
	make WRT_THROUGH: compile the policy of cache consistency by the write through
	
	make compile: compile the Cache Simulator configed 
	make demo : to execute the simulator system
	make clean : clean the filed generated by the system


Config:
	the config need to be done in type.h
	config info:
		for debug : INFO/ERROR/DEBUG
		memory size,command width,cpu number,
		cacheline size,cache level,cache size,cache assoc,
		write assignment or not write assignment
		write update or write invalid
		config the LRU evict policy and write through




Flexible Modify:
modify trace:
	Memory trace : memory.cpp
	Command trace : command.cpp

modify protocol:
	lru.cpp
	wrt_through.cpp
